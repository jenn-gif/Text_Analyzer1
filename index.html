    </center>
    <p> <strong>Introduction</strong> <br> Each writer sooner or later has battled with word count. Regardless of whether it is missing the mark concerning a necessary length or composing your personal novel, word tally has been elusive objective.
    </p>
    <p>Students need to perform different kinds of assignments, writing activities such as case studies, questionnaires, research papers, essays and reports which require a certain amount of word count length. Although a bit of leeway is usually
      given, if you are well off the count either way, you could lose marks</p>
    <p>While in digital marketing circles, the rules remain the same. Posts that are too short or too long can hinder your rankings, while content that is at an adequate length performs better. So, word-count is a significant factor when managing
      SEO.</p>
    <p>Checking each word physically and precisely will be drawn-out work , constructing a website or application can resolve this issue .</p>
    <p>Text Analyzer is a website that is created by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is perfect tool for anyone who needs to keep a count of their words and characters, but doesnâ€™t use Microsoft Word.</p>
    <p>This text tool is designed to boost your productivity and make your life easier. The website can be extremely useful when posting or submitting to platforms which have limits imposed on number of characters, words or size.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works ?</strong> <br>It will take input as text or long paragraphs, then the browser will count all the collection of words separated with a space blank. Space blank acts as a reminder for the processor, it counts the array of
      alphabets and adds it to the previous value</p>
    <p> <strong>What is regarded as a word?</strong> <br>A word contains many characters (even including emoji) which are separated by spaces. </p>
    <p> <strong>What is regarded as a character?</strong> <br> Any printable or non-printable like spaces are counted as a character, which constitues the character count.</p>
